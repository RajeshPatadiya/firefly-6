# Introduction
Kotlin is a graceful modern programming language. It is a great fit for developing server-side applications. Firefly Java APIs is fully compatible with Kotlin. That means you can use the Firefly framework in the Kotlin directly. But the Kotlin provides coroutine, reified type parameter, type-safe builder and many other powerful features. The coroutine simplifies building the asynchronous applications. It makes the programs are shorter and far simpler to understand and enjoy the scalability and performance benefits of asynchronous codes. The reified type parameter and type-safe builder reduces the amount of boilerplate code and helps up to build powerful and easy-to-use abstractions. So we decide to use these powerful features to build new Firefly Kotlin DSL APIs.

# The first example
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
    val host = "localhost"
    val port = 8081

    HttpServer {
        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/hello"

            asyncHandler {
                end("hello world")
            }
        }
    }.listen(host, port)

    val resp = firefly.httpClient().get("http://$host:$port/hello").asyncSubmit()
    println(resp.status)
    println(resp.stringBody)
}
```

Run it. The console shows:
```
200
hello world
```

In this example, we demonstrate how to use the Kotlin DSL to build an HTTP server. You can write the business logic in the `asyncHandler` block. It runs on the coroutines.

The HTTP client uses the `asyncSubmit` function to wait for the response. This function runs on the coroutine. It can avoid "callback hell" effectively. It is similar to the synchronous blocking code style. But the `asyncSubmit` function does not block current thread. It only suspends the current function. More details, you can see the [Kotlin coroutine document](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html).

# Route order
By default, routes are matched in the order which they are added to the router manager. But you can also specify a router ID to decide the route order.
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
    val host = "localhost"
    val port = 8081

    HttpServer {
        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/routeOrder"

            asyncHandler {
                write("The first router.\r\n").next()
            }
        }

        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/routeOrder"

            asyncHandler {
                end("The last router.")
            }
        }
    }.listen(host, port)

    val resp = firefly.httpClient().get("http://$host:$port/routeOrder").asyncSubmit()
    println(resp.status)
    println(resp.stringBody)
}
```
Run it. The console shows:
```
200
The first router.
The last router.
```

Specify a router ID to decide the route order:
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
    val host = "localhost"
    val port = 8081

    HttpServer {
        router(101) {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/routeOrder"

            asyncHandler {
                end("Into router ${getId()}.")
            }
        }

        router(100) {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/routeOrder"

            asyncHandler {
                write("Into router ${getId()}.\r\n").next()
            }
        }
    }.listen(host, port)

    val resp = firefly.httpClient().get("http://$host:$port/routeOrder").asyncSubmit()
    println(resp.status)
    println(resp.stringBody)
}
```
Run it. The console shows:
```
200
Into router 100.
Into router 101.
```

# Set the handler listener
The Kotlin HTTP server execute handler asynchronously. If you want to listen the next handler complete event, you need use `asyncNext` function and set a listener. For example:
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
    val host = "localhost"
    val port = 8081

    HttpServer {
        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/handlerListener"

            asyncHandler {
                write("Into the first handler.\r\n")
                asyncNext<String> {
                    write(it)
                    end("Complete the first handler.")
                }
            }
        }

        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/handlerListener"

            asyncHandler {
                write("Into the second handler.\r\n")
                asyncNext<String> {
                    write(it)
                    asyncSucceed("Complete the second handler.\r\n")
                }
            }
        }

        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/handlerListener"

            asyncHandler {
                write("Into the last handler.\r\n")
                asyncSucceed("Complete the last handler.\r\n")
            }
        }
    }.listen(host, port)

    val resp = firefly.httpClient().get("http://$host:$port/handlerListener").asyncSubmit()
    println(resp.status)
    println(resp.stringBody)
}
```

Run it. The console shows:
```
200
Into the first handler.
Into the second handler.
Into the last handler.
Complete the last handler.
Complete the second handler.
Complete the first handler.
```

The `asyncNext` function receives two parameters:
- _**succeeded**_ - The handler complete listener. You can call the `asyncSucceed` function to fire this listener.
- _**failed**_ - The handler exception listener. By the default, the exception event is ignored. If you want to listen the exception event, when the handler throws an exception, you need catch it and call the `asyncFail` function to fire this listener.

# Capturing path parameters
Itâ€™s possible to match paths using placeholders for parameters. The placeholders consist of ":" followed by the parameter name. Parameter names consist of any alphabetic character, numeric character or underscore. For example:
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
    val host = "localhost"
    val port = 8081

    HttpServer {
        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/product/:id"

            asyncHandler {
                val id = getPathParameter("id")
                end("Get the product $id")
            }
        }
    }.listen(host, port)

    val resp = firefly.httpClient().get("http://$host:$port/product/20").asyncSubmit()
    println(resp.status)
    println(resp.stringBody)
}
```
Run it. The console shows:
```
200
Get the product 20
```

# Routing by wildcard
Often you want to route all requests that accord with a pattern. You could use a regex to do this, but a simply way is to use an asterisk wildcard `*`. For example:
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
    val host = "localhost"
    val port = 8081

    HttpServer {
        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/product*"

            asyncHandler {
                val matched = getWildcardMatchedResult(0)
                write("Intercept the product: $matched\r\n")
                asyncNext<String> {
                    end(it)
                }
            }
        }

        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/product/:type"

            asyncHandler {
                val type = getPathParameter("type")
                write("List $type\r\n")
                asyncSucceed("List $type success")
            }
        }
    }.listen(host, port)

    val resp = firefly.httpClient().get("http://$host:$port/product/apple").asyncSubmit()
    println(resp.status)
    println(resp.stringBody)
}
```
Run it. The console shows:
```
200
Intercept the product: /apple
List apple
List apple success
```
We use the `getWildcardMatchedResult` function to get the matched part and the index starts from 0.

# Routing by regular expressions
Regular expressions can also be used to match URI paths in routes. For example:
```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {
    val host = "localhost"
    val port = 8081

    HttpServer {
        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            regexPath = "/product(.*)"

            asyncHandler {
                val matched = getRegexGroup(1)
                write("Intercept the product: $matched\r\n")
                asyncNext<String> {
                    end(it)
                }
            }
        }

        router {
            httpMethod = HttpMethod.GET
            path = "/product/:type"

            asyncHandler {
                val type = getPathParameter("type")
                write("List $type\r\n")
                asyncSucceed("List $type success")
            }
        }
    }.listen(host, port)

    val resp = firefly.httpClient().get("http://$host:$port/product/orange").asyncSubmit()
    println(resp.status)
    println(resp.stringBody)
}
```
Run it. The console shows:
```
200
Intercept the product: /orange
List orange
List orange success
```
We use the `getRegexGroup` function to get the matched group and the index starts from 1.
