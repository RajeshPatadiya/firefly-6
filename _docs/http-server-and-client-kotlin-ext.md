title: HTTP server and client Kotlin extension

# Introduction
Kotlin is a graceful modern programming language. It is a great fit for developing server-side applications. Firefly Java APIs is fully compatible with Kotlin. That means you can use the Firefly framework in the Kotlin directly. But the Kotlin provides coroutine, reified type parameter, type-safe builder and many other powerful features. The coroutine simplifies building the asynchronous applications. It makes the programs are shorter and far simpler to understand and enjoy the scalability and performance benefits of asynchronous codes. The reified type parameter and type-safe builder reduces the amount of boilerplate code and helps up to build powerful and easy-to-use abstractions. So we decide to use these powerful features to build new Firefly Kotlin DSL APIs.
